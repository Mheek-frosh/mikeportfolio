These experiences have shaped me into striving for simplicity and clarity in my work while finding ways to solve the challenging tasks it takes to build a product that puts a smile on the end user's face.On the side I do enjoy building small and large personal projects as a chance to learn new technologies and break things. When I'm not building or trying to break things Its either movies, books or music like most other people, I think.",
